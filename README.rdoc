== About this fork

I forked http://github.com/QuBiT/exception_logger to get it working with Rails 3.2.3.  ÃŸome of the AJAX functionality is still broken.

== Install

Inside your Gemfile:

  gem 'exception_logger', :git => 'https://github.com/alexfarrill/exception_logger' 

and then run:

  bundle install

Inside your ApplicationController:

  include ExceptionLogger::ExceptionLoggable # loades the module
  rescue_from Exception, :with => :log_exception_handler # tells rails to forward the 'Exception' (you can change the type) to the handler of the module

=== Database Setup

Use

  rails g exception_logger:migration

This will create a database migration

  TIMESTAMP_add_exception_table.rb

inside db/migrations

== Routing

The gem is preconfigured to extend your routes automatically. You can access the logged exceptions by pointing to "/logged_exceptions" inside your application.

You can use the rake tasks

  rake routes

to see and check the routes.

== Exception Notification

== Authentication

If you want, and believe me you want that, you can add the following lines to your environment to enable Authentication

Example uses the declarative_authorization gem

in config/environment/production.rb:

  config.after_initialize do
    LoggedExceptionsController.class_eval do
      # include any custom auth modules you need
      # (declarative authorization gem used)
      filter_resource_access
      # just add any code you want to be included in the controller ;)
      # optional, sets the application name for the rss feeds
      self.application_name = "Your Application Name"
    end
  end

and (if you use declarative_authorization) add this to your authorization_rules.rb file:

  role :admin do
    has_permission_on :logged_exceptions, :to => :manage
    ...

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
